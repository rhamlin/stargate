# CRUD
Stargate offers a request-optimized database microservices layer. After you create your [schema definition](schema_definition.md), you can call the database with standard REST conventions.

## URL Convention
URLs have the convention of `/{namespace}/{entity}` with the operation being specified via the HTTP method. 

For example: These are all valid urls in the [Todo database](getting_started_todo_app.md):
- GET http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo - queries existing Todos
- POST http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo - creates new Todos
- PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo - updates existing Todos
- DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo - deletes existing Todos
- GET http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/continue/Todo/{continueId} - continues a paginated GET query

## Queries
Queries are any `GET` request on a `/v1/api/{namespace}/query/entity/{entity}` path.
Queries can be specified and called at runtime, called flexible queries, or they can defined upfront
in your datamodel configuration to give you a convenient API. Queries can accept the following flags in their JSON payload:
* **`"-match"`** A query on an entity can have any match statement defined in the `queryCondition` block in the schema. 
    Match flags can only be at the root level of the query. Match statements are **required** for queries.
* **`"-include"`** Which fields to include in the result. If nothing is specified, all scalar fields are returned. 
* **`"-limit"`** The maximum number of results to be returned.
* **`"-continue"`** Either true or false - controls if a paging token may be included in the result, used to fetch additional entities.
* **`"-ttl"`** How long the paging token is valid (in seconds)

The following query returns a paginated list of the first 100 Todos with "title" and "isComplete" fields that are related to user John Doe.
```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{
 "-match": ["user.username", "=", "John Doe"], 
 "-limit": 100,
 "-include": [ "title", "isComplete"] ,
 "-continue": true,
 "-ttl": 120,
 "user": {}
 }
}
'
```

### Predefined Queries
Queries can also be pre-defined, access with from the path `/v1/api/{namespace}/query/stored/{queryName}`. These are the queries that are defined in the [Queries Block](schema_definition.md).
The following flags are supported:
 - limit
 - continue
 - ttl

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/stored/todoByUsername" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{
 "-match": {"username": "John Doe"}, 
 "-limit": 100,
 "-continue": true,
 "-ttl": 120
 }
}
'
```

### Getting all records
You can retrieve all entities by `"-match": "all"`

## Pagination
When calling an query with a `-continue` flag, the last result in the list may be a paging token. Specifically, if your query has a continue=true and limit=10
but there are 15 results that match, the query will return 10 entities with the 11th element in the list being a continue token.  If no 11th element is returned,
then there are no remaining entities to fetch. 
There is a special URL path called `continue` which will accept this paging token.
-  `/v1/api/{namespace}/query/continue/{token}`

For example
```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/continue/8ffac247-77a5-4f38-94c0-ad2b0e95c9ae"
```

Result:
```
[{"title":"Create a Relation","isComplete":false,"user":[]},{"-continue":"8ffac247-77a5-4f38-94c0-ad2b0e95c9ae"}]
```

You can continue to call the paging api with the same token. The page is complete if no continue token is at the end of the list.
## Mutations
Stargate allows a flexible API to manipulate data in Cassandra.
### Create
Create operations are any `POST` request on an entity's path. Create operations have a root entity that will be created as well as relationships that can be linked, unlinked, or replaced.
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
 "title": "Create a Relation",
 "isComplete": false
}
'
```
### Update 
Update operations are any `PUT` request on an entity's path. Update operations require a `match` clause. Both scalars and relationships can be updated with an update statement.
```sh
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
 "-match": ["user.username", "=", "John Doe"],
 "isComplete": true
}
'
```
### Delete
Delete operations are any `DELETE` request on an entity's path. Delete operations require a `match` clause. All matching entities will be removed, and they will no longer be related
to any other entities.

Removing Todo and all of its relationships:
```sh
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
  "-match": ["user.username", "=", "John Doe"]
}
'
```

Additionally, if you wish to recursively delete Users that are related to the matching Todos, you can include that relation in the payload.
Similar to a GET query, you can traverse as deep as you wish in the relation tree, which will keep deleting more transitively related entities.
```sh
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
  "-match": ["user.username", "=", "John Doe"],
  "user": {}
}
'
```

### Relationship management
Relationships can be added, removed, or replaced on any entity.
* **`"-link"`"**- Allows adding relationships to an entity. Accepts a `create`, `match`, or `update` flag.
* **`"-unlink"`**- Allows removing relationships from an entity. Accepts a list of match conditions.
* **`"-replace"`**- Takes a list of relationships that will be the new set of relationships. Accepts a `create`, `match`, or `update` flag.

Adding a new todo and connecting it to an existing user:
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
 "title": "Create a Relation",
 "isComplete": false,
 "user": {
   "-match": ["username", "=", "John Doe"]
 }
}
'
```
Update todos to give them to a User:
```sh
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/v1/api/test/query/entity/Todo" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d'
{ 
 "-match": ["isComplete", "=", false],
 "isComplete": true,
 "user": {
   "-replace": {
      "-match": ["username", "=", "John Doe"]
   }
 }
}
