Stargate is an ORM and service layer for Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise.  Given a logical data model of entities, relationships, and queries Stargate will generate the appropriate data model in Apache Cassandra or DataStax Enterprise.

## Benefits

* No CQL required. Work directly with a RESTful, microservice-friendly API.
* Allows you to stay focused on building your app and its queries, rather than how you want Cassandra to store your data.
* Stargate is fully Cloud Native which means you can easily run Stargate on EKS, GCE, or your own local Kubernetes cluster. However, you don’t need Kubernetes to run Stargate.
* Relax: Think about how you want to query your data, rather than how you want to store it.
* Low Code: Get a well tuned and optimized http REST endpoint and driver with no code

## Stargate is built for ...

People that need to ship now and ship fast. Such as: 

* Front end developers building something that needs to scale
* Small consulting shops trying to deliver to several customers on a deadline
* New to NoSQL user just trying to make sense of it all

## Getting Started

* [Getting started in 3 quick steps](docs/getting_started.md)
* [Build a Todo application database in 5 minutes](docs/getting_started_todo_app.md)

## Understanding Stargate
* [Schema Definition](docs/schema_definition.md)
* [CRUD Operations](docs/crud.md)
* [Deploy](docs/deploy.md)
* [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

## Features
* **Cloud native.** Scale-out and in with workload demand. Be highly available and resilient to failure. Have quick response times across all channels.
* **It just works.** You give us a logical data model and Stargate gives you a deployable microservice. Stargate handles the database and schema.
* **CRUD made easy.** Stargate exposes a fully featured CRUD API. Create, update, and delete records in cassandra with ease.
* **Advanced Cassandra support.** Trust that your database can scale out horizontally to meet increasing workload demand. 

### Command line utility

Ok now you're sold, go download the binaries [here](https://github.com/datastax/stargate/releases/latest) for the command line utility. 

### Production

We provide a basic references for the things you may want to enable in production [here](docs/production.md)

## Contributing

Requirements:

* [OpenJDK 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) if you want to build the image.
* [Apache Cassandra 3.11](https://cassandra.apache.org/) or [DSE 6.8](https://downloads.datastax.com/#enterprise)

Run the following:

    git clone git@github.com:datastax/stargate
    mvn compile test
    mvn exec:exec #with DSE or Apache Cassandra running in the background

If all this is working satisfactory you are ready to develop new features for Stargate.

### Debugging

Changing the `stargate` logger from `INFO` to `TRACE` will give a per request headers and output, not appropriate to run very long in production but should be fine in a dev context.
See the following example:

    <logger name="stargate" level="info" additivity="false">
to

    <logger name="stargate" level="trace" additivity="false">
